# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Eduardo Arias

I'm a Mathematical Engineer specializing in Scientific Computing and Modeling. I'm passionate about leveraging data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems. Throughout my career, I've played key roles in research, data analysis, and the development of advanced analytical tools.

## ðŸ”­ Currently working at CEIE, UTE University

- Designing and implementing automation to optimize data analysis and management processes, significantly improving the center's operational efficiency.
- Developing and maintaining a robust database for efficient storage and handling of academic information, using advanced tools such as Django for data writing integration and automation.
- Conducting complex psychometric analyses using Item Response Theory (IRT) and Classical Test Theory (CTT), contributing to more accurate and evidence-based educational assessment.

## ðŸŒ± Skills and Experience

- **Data Analysis and Machine Learning**: Extensive experience in exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, and mathematical modeling. Proficient in using Python (numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) for data analysis and visualization, and frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn for machine learning applications.

- **Database Management**: In-depth knowledge of SQL and PostgreSQL for relational database management, schema design, and query optimization. Experience with MongoDB for handling document-oriented databases and Neo4j for graph-oriented databases.

- **Algorithmic Trading**: Developed and implemented advanced data analysis and AI models to guide strategic decisions in algorithmic trading projects, improving operational efficiency.

- **Geospatial Data Analysis**: Utilized H3 for geospatial data analysis and Pyro for probabilistic programming to develop innovative geographical models.

- **Backend Development**: Experienced in backend development, ensuring robust, scalable, and efficient data processing infrastructures.

- **Research and Publications**: Collaborated on research projects analyzing the existence of weak solutions for biharmonic equations with nonlinear discontinuities. Published a paper titled "A biharmonic equation with discontinuous nonlinearities" in the Electronic Journal of Differential Equations.
